## Talks

### Celsius: Types Are Cool [@nathany](https://twitter.com/nathany) ([video](https://vimeo.com/86278568), [code](https://github.com/edmontongo/presentations/tree/master/2014-01/celsius)) 

We will refactor some procedural code, learning how to use types and methods in Go.

*This talk is suitable for programmers new to the Go language.*

### Concurrency Is Not Parallelism [@rob_pike](https://twitter.com/rob_pike) ([video](https://vimeo.com/49718712), [slides](http://talks.golang.org/2012/waza.slide#1), [code](https://github.com/edmontongo/presentations/tree/master/2014-01/robpike))
  
Concurrency is a way of structuring code that can enable parallel execution. After a number of seemingly silly examples, Rob Pike wraps up with a complete load balancer written in Go.

*The load balancer code will be available to examine, run and discuss after the video.  The example is fairly advanced, but the principals can be understood by all.*

*Popcorn and beverages to be provided.*
