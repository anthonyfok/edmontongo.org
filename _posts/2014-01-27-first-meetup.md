We will refactor some procedural code, learning how to use types and methods in Go.

*This talk is suitable for programmers new to the Go language.*

### Concurrency Is Not Parallelism [@rob_pike](https://twitter.com/rob_pike) (video)
  
Rob Pike explains how concurrency is a way of thinking that can enable parallel execution. He then presents a complete load balancer.

*The code at the end of this talk is somewhat advanced, but the principals can be understood by all.*
