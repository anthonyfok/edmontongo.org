## Talks

### Google App Engine

[Chris Olsen](https://github.com/chrisolsen) will be sharing what he has learned about [using Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)

### BYOC (Bring Your Own Code)

We are encouraging attendees to bring a small Go code sample that they've written and would like to share. We plan to break into small groups to discuss and learn together. Consider things you have written that you found neat, challenging, or are proud of. Smaller is better.
