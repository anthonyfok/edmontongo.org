## Talks

#### Coding for Concurrency: Processes, Threads, and Goroutines by [Nicholas Boers](https://github.com/boersn)

#### Reasons to read The Go Programming Language by [Jordan Torbiak](https://github.com/torbiak)

The Go Programming Language provides great value as a reference in general and in particular for testing and reflection, as a collection of interesting exercises in a reasonable order, and as a comprehensive textbook after more introductory material like the Tour and Effective Go.
