### Packer

[Packer](https://packer.io/) is a tool building machine images written in Go. Our resident devops guru, [Fletcher Nichol](https://twitter.com/fnichol), from Chef Software will be presenting on it.

### Code reading

Back by popular demand, we'll be doing a code reading activity in small groups.

Some suggestions:

* [container/heap](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/container/heap) is a [heap data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure) interface provided by the Go standard library
* [negroni](https://github.com/codegangsta/negroni) is a middleware stack for Go ([interpose](https://github.com/carbocation/interpose) is an alternative)
* [gorilla/pat](https://github.com/gorilla/pat) is a request router, and much simpler than [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
* [gorilla/context](https://github.com/gorilla/context) is a registry for request variables

## Events

* GopherCon 2015 - [July 8-9](http://www.gophercon.com/) at the Colorado Convention Center
